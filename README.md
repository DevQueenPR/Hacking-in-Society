# Cybercrime and Hacking Study

## Overview

Hacking has been a significant issue in society ever since the advent of technology. Cybercrime affects many aspects of life and has widespread consequences. This study aims to inform society about the various aspects of hacking, its effects on society, and ways to mitigate its prevalence. The research addresses three main questions:
1. What are the types of hacking?
2. How does hacking affect society?
3. How can the crime of hacking be minimized?

Through this study, it was concluded that malware, including viruses, Trojans, and ransomware, is the primary form of hacking. Hacking has both positive and negative effects, but its overall impact on society is more negative. Effective measures, such as two-factor authentication, can minimize hacking by 99%. 

## Key Findings

- **Types of Hacking**: Malware, including viruses, Trojans, and ransomware, is the most common form of hacking.
- **Impact on Society**: Cybercrime leads to significant economic and psychological consequences, with victims often experiencing anxiety, anger, and other emotional issues.
- **Minimizing Hacking**: The most effective way to minimize hacking is through two-factor authentication and regular device updates.
  
## Research Methodology

The research was conducted using **quantitative methods** based on secondary data from certified studies. The analysis focused on exploring the types of hacking, the societal impact, and possible solutions.

## Structure of the Study

### Introduction
- **Significance of the Problem**: Hacking poses a significant threat to both personal and organizational security.
- **Summary of the Problem**: Cyberattacks have increased dramatically, especially ransomware, which is on the rise in places like Puerto Rico.
- **Problem Statement**: There is insufficient awareness regarding the dangers of hacking and how to protect against it.

### Literature Review
- **Cybercriminals**: Hackers are skilled individuals who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.
- **Economic Impact**: Cybercrime costs the global economy billions annually.
- **Victims**: Victims of hacking suffer psychological and emotional distress.
- **Security and Prevention**: Implementing strong cybersecurity measures, including two-factor authentication, can drastically reduce the risk of hacking.

### Methods
- **Data Collection**: Secondary data was collected from reliable internet sources.
- **Data Analysis**: An exploratory quantitative analysis was performed to explore relationships between various aspects of hacking and cybercrime.

### Conclusion
- **Key Conclusion**: The crime of hacking can be minimized by educating society, using advanced security measures, and staying updated with technology. Regular use of two-factor authentication can prevent the majority of hacking attempts.

## Future Research

The study opens avenues for further research, including:
- The impact of cryptocurrency on hacking methods.
- Technologies being developed to prevent cybercrime.
- Strategies to minimize hacker groups.

## Limitations and Challenges

Some limitations encountered during the research include:
- Limited data on cybercrime victims in certain regions (especially Puerto Rico).
- The reliability of secondary data and honesty of survey participants.
